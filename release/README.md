# Release automation

The `release/` directory houses the configuration and documentation that keep store builds reproducible. Artifacts generated by
`scripts/build-release.js` live under `release/artifacts/<version>/<target>/` along with metadata describing how every ZIP was 
produced. Store uploads can reference these JSON files to understand the commit, manifest version, checksum, and any manual steps
that were taken when drafting the listing.

## Targets configuration

`targets.json` enumerates every browser store we support. Each target entry can:

- Customize the friendly display name shown in logs and metadata.
- Override the archive filename prefix (`archiveName`).
- Append additional `zip` exclusions on top of the shared `globalExcludes` block.

When you add a new store, place any store-specific documentation inside `release/<version>/<target>/` after the build completes.
The script drops a `STORE_NOTES.md` template in each folder so you can jot down reviewer discussions or content policy deltas.

## Artifacts folder

`release/artifacts/` is ignored by Git because the ZIP files are large, but the directory structure makes it easy to keep a local,
versioned collection of what you uploaded to each store. Re-running `npm run build` for the same version simply overwrites the ZIP
and metadata files so you can regenerate a package whenever you update documentation or rebuild on a new machine.
